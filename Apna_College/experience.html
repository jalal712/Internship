    <h3>Intership:</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently interning at a local software development company where I
      am gaining hands-on experience in web development and project management.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my internship, I have worked on several projects, including
      developing a client management system and enhancing the company's website
      functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experience has allowed me to apply my academic knowledge in a
      real-world setting and improve my technical skills.
